        My favourite video Game character is Mario.the first Mario game I played was at my cousins house when I was 4 years old.I love this game becouse both characters looks and how they express themselves represents me and my cousin.some of the common things are we are very athletic we both are short and we both like pizza we bothe do not give up easily we both like to be out side my cousin is like my other favret carictors that is luigi.luigi and my cousin is both scared of the dark my cousin is taller than me like luigi is taller than Mario and we both car aubout each other alot.
